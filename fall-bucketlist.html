            <h2>A little preface...</h2>
            <p>So, I'm a senior now but it feels like I haven't experienced fall in New York City since freshman year. I was so busy with pre-med classes during my sophomore year and then I studied abroad in Berlin during fall of junior year. So it's been a while! And I don't want to let my last fall as an undergradate at NYU slip away.<br><br>
            <strong><i>Now entering: my Fall Bucketlist!</strong></i>
            On this webpage, I want to write down my goals for the upcoming fall semester (from social events to academic, professional and more!) so that I can check back on this page every now and then to make sure I'm progressing towards my ideal self!</p>

                <img src="images/when_harry_met_sally_01.jpg" length=245px height=345px alt='Photo of an iconic scene from the movie "When Harry Met Sally" that perfectly encapsulates New York City in the fall.'>
                <p id="WHMS-text">Quick note: I highly, highly recommend the movie that this photo is from! It's called "When Harry Met Sally" and is perfect for the fall. It's one of those 90s rom-coms (my favorite movie genre) starring Meg Ryan and Billy Crystal. I love these two together!</p>
